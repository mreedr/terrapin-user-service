Eventbrite EMAIL:

We need the Eventbrite Order Service API to be able to do partial refunds for guests.
We also need to be able to transfer ownership of ticket holders. In our system, when someone
transfers a ticket we disable their barcodes and grant a brand new one to the transferree.
This ensures no one can reuse barcodes. By issuing new tickets each time it exchanges hands we can ensure
customers a valid ticket when they get to the gates. This also means we need to be able to create
orders programmatically. We would like to drop an iframe on our site to allow guests to sell their tickets
for face value. This discourages fake credit cards since "selling" a ticket only refunds the original
owner. This is especially useful for passes like Parking, VIP Upgrade and RV.

It would be nice to put a link on their ticket to transfer their ticket. Problem with this is we would need to manage
accounts... I guess we already do.

It would be nice if we could move a ticket from one eventbrite "account" to another

It would be nice if we could give the scanner a message if the ticket was sold through TT. I guess kevin
and I could just check. We can check the history of all the ticket buys/sells. We can even tell them that
their ticket got refunded.

We can make a one stop lookup system.


We feel we have a new and innovative way for users to exchange tickets online.



Transfers:!!! can only be done through eventbrite !!!! !!

The reason we issue new tickets is because we don't
